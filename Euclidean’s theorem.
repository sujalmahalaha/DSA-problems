 Using Euclideanâ€™s theorem.

Intuition: Gcd is the greatest number which is divided by both a and b.If a number is divided by both a and b, it is should be divided by (a-b) and b as well.


Approach:

Recursively call gcd(b,a%b) function till the base condition is hit.
b==0 is the base condition.When base condition is hit return a,as gcd(a,0) is equal to a.
Code


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int gcd(int a, int b) {
	if (b == 0) {
		return a;
	}
	return gcd(b, a % b);
}
